# Introduction

JokeAPI is a REST API that serves uniformly and well formatted jokes.
It can be used without any API token, membership, registration or payment.
It supports a variety of filters that can be applied to get just the right jokes you need.
The usage is very simple and similar to other RESTful APIs and requires only basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON, XML, YAML or plain text.

If you come across a term you don't understand, you can try opening the menu and clicking on the section "Terminology".
JokeAPI currently serves 1368 jokes from 6 different languages. To submit a new joke, please click here.
